# Employee Tracker

## Description

Finally, a place for you to keep track of your team members--whether it be their role, their department, or the employee's themselves! By employing MySQL, you have access to all of this at your fingertips...or, at least, at the command line.

## Installation

To use the Employee Tracker, you'll need access to a whole slew of files--at the root you'll find index.js, which you run from the command line, and you'll be prompted by the inquirer package to answer questions related to each action you want to do. You'll need Node.js to download npm, inquirer package for logging user responses. You'll also need access to MySQL. Using your command line, you can do all these steps and be on your way in no time!

## Usage

When you run "node index.js" (or just, "node index" for those busy bees out there with no time to spare), you'll be prompted with a series of questions, all of which you, the user, are required to answer. By answering the questions, you can create a whole network of employees, including managers, their roles, and departments!
