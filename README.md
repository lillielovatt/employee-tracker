- use constructor functions for SQL 
You might want to use a separate file that contains functions for performing specific SQL queries you'll need to use. A constructor function or class could be helpful for organizing these.
- for SQL, I understand the commands

select * from department
select * from roles
select * from employees and then need to join on roles 

insert into [tablename] (all params,more params) values(?,?)
^for employee, role, dept

update [tablename] set [param-to-update]=? where [unique id]=?

<!-- combine files using Joins -->


- inquirer.prompt more efficient/elegant, base on Maryus' idea

- understanding async and await
